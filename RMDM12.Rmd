# Schoolvio FAQ

### 1. Data source?

> *This dataset was published by the Center for Homeland Defense and Security. Data contains number of shooting incidents per year, number of victims, location, time period, and many other variables.*

### 2. Overall goal?

> *To use different methods of analysis to find trends or common variables linking the data together, and visualize them on a map.*

### 3. Additional libraries needed?

> *Not needed, but some functions plotting the dataset may use ggplot2 or other plotting libraries. They will be included in the code.*

### 4. Problem with code?

> *Send a ticket through my GitHub repository. I'll look at the ticket at my earliest convenience, or hopefully someone else can solve the issue there.*
